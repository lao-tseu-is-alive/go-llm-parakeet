Parakeet is the simplest Go library to create **GenAI apps** with **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)**.

> A GenAI app is an application that uses generative AI technology. Generative AI can create new text, images, or other content based on what it's been trained on. So a GenAI app could help you write a poem, design a logo, or even compose a song! These are still under development, but they have the potential to be creative tools for many purposes. - [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)

> âœ‹ Parakeet is only for creating GenAI apps generating **text** (not image, music,...).
