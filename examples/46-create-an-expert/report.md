**common name:** T. rex  
**description:** T. rex was one of the largest land carnivores, measuring up to 40 feet in length. It had powerful jaws capable of crushing bones and small, ineffective arms. It inhabited forested regions of North America during the late Cretaceous period.

#### Velociraptor mongoliensis
**name:** **Velociraptor mongoliensis**  
**common name:** Velociraptor  
**description:** Velociraptor was a small, agile predator about the size of a turkey, with a long tail and sharp claws. It lived in the late Cretaceous period in what is now Mongolia, possibly hunting in packs.

#### Allosaurus fragilis
**name:** **Allosaurus fragilis**  
**common name:** Allosaurus  
**description:** Allosaurus was a large theropod, reaching lengths of 28 feet. Known for its sickle-shaped claws and robust skull, it thrived during the late Jurassic period in North America, preying on large herbivorous dinosaurs.

## Variety: Sauropoda
*Description:*
Sauropoda includes some of the largest land animals to ever exist. These long-necked herbivores are characterized by their enormous size, long tails, and small heads relative to their bodies. They grazed on vegetation in diverse environments, from open plains to lush forests.

### Dinosaurs:

#### Brachiosaurus altithorax
**name:** **Brachiosaurus altithorax**  
**common name:** Brachiosaurus  
**description:** Standing about 40 feet tall, Brachiosaurus had long forelimbs that gave its body an upright posture. It inhabited North America during the late Jurassic and was known for feeding on tall trees, thanks to its elevated neck.

#### Diplodocus longus
**name:** **Diplodocus longus**  
**common name:** Diplodocus  
**description:** Diplodocus was one of the longest dinosaurs, reaching over 85 feet in length. It had a long neck and whip-like tail, grazing on low-growing vegetation in the late Jurassic period, primarily in North America.

#### Apatosaurus ajax
**name:** **Apatosaurus ajax**  
**common name:** Apatosaurus  
**description:** Apatosaurus, formerly known as Brontosaurus, was a massive sauropod measuring about 75 feet long. It had a long neck and became a staple in American Jurassic ecosystems, feeding on soft vegetation.

## Variety: Ornithischia
*Description:*
Ornithischia is a diverse clade of herbivorous dinosaurs characterized by bird-like hips. They exhibit a wide range of shapes and sizes, from small armored dinosaurs to giant, horned species, and inhabited various ecosystems during the Mesozoic era.

### Dinosaurs:

#### Stegosaurus ungulatus
**name:** **Stegosaurus ungulatus**  
**common name:** Stegosaurus  
**description:** Notable for its distinctive back plates and spiked tail, Stegosaurus was a slow-moving herbivore from the late Jurassic period, primarily found in North America. Its plates may have been used for display or thermoregulation.

#### Triceratops horridus
**name:** **Triceratops horridus**  
**common name:** Triceratops  
**description:** Triceratops was a large quadrupedal dinosaur with three facial horns and a large frill protecting its neck. It lived in herds during the late Cretaceous period in North America, primarily feeding on low shrubs.

#### Ankylosaurus magniventris
**name:** **Ankylosaurus magniventris**  
**common name:** Ankylosaurus  
**description:** With its heavily armored body and a club-like tail, Ankylosaurus was designed for defense against predators. This robust dinosaur lived during the late Cretaceous in North America and fed on low-growing plants.

## Variety: Ceratopsia
*Description:*
Ceratopsia is a group of herbivorous dinosaurs recognized for their frills and facial horns. These dinosaurs thrived during the late Cretaceous period, displaying a variety of horn arrangements and body sizes. They primarily occupied North America and Asia.

### Dinosaurs:

#### Protoceratops andrewsi
**name:** **Protoceratops andrewsi**  
**common name:** Protoceratops  
**description:** Protoceratops was a small ceratopsian, about the size of a sheep, that lived in Mongolia during the late Cretaceous. Its distinctive frill and beak-like mouth made it well-adapted for grazing on vegetation.

#### Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis
**name:** **Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis**  
**common name:** Pachycephalosaurus  
**description:** Known for its thick, domed skull, Pachycephalosaurus may have engaged in head-butting behavior. It lived in the late Cretaceous in North America and had a herbivorous diet.

#### Torosaurus latus
**name:** **Torosaurus latus**  
**common name:** Torosaurus  
**description:** Torosaurus featured a large frill with two prominent horns and is often associated with Triceratops. It lived in the late Cretaceous in North America and likely grazed on low-lying vegetation.
