# MCP: model context protocol, SSE CLient

For this set of examples, I'm using a MCP server with the SSE transport: [WASImancer](https://github.com/sea-monkeys/WASImancer). WASImancer provide MCP tools based on WebAssembly plugins.

## Start Docker distribution of WASImancer

```bash
cd server
docker compose up
# the plugins are already built
```

Then, you can run every samples of the current directory
