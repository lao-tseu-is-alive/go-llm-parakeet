# How to run this example

Ref: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html

## Elastic
To store embeddings in Elasticsearch using the Golang client, you'll need to follow these steps:

**Start Elasticsearch and Kibana**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Wait for some seconds until the services are up and running.
Then, a `certs` directory will be created with the certificates needed to connect to Elasticsearch.

> To stop the Docker Compose stack, run: `docker compose down`

### Test the connection with the certificate

```bash
export ELASTIC_PASSWORD=iloveparakeets
curl --cacert ./certs/ca/ca.crt -u elastic:$ELASTIC_PASSWORD https://localhost:9200
```

You should get something like this:
```bash
{
  "name" : "602f990409e9",
  "cluster_name" : "docker-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid" : "IaF2jmr0SwS8RrsiHMrDcw",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "8.15.0",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "docker",
    "build_hash" : "1a77947f34deddb41af25e6f0ddb8e830159c179",
    "build_date" : "2024-08-05T10:05:34.233336849Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.11.1",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "7.17.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

## Run the samples

This example demonstrates how to store embeddings in Elasticsearch and perform a vector similarity search using the Go client.

### Create the embeddings

```bash
cd create-embeddings
go run main.go
```

### Check if the embeddings are stored

- Go to Kibana: http://0.0.0.0:5601/app/management/data/index_management/indices
- Log in with the user "elastic" and password "iloveparakeets"
- Open the console and run the following query:
    ```bash
    GET /chronicles-index/_search
    ```
You should see the embeddings stored in the index `chronicles-index`:

### Perform a vector similarity search

```bash
cd use-embeddings
go run main.go
```

[This program](use-embeddings/main.go) completes the prompt: "Tell me more about Keegorg". If everything works, you'll see it answered from embeddings derived from [chronicles.md](create-embeddings/chronicles.md).
