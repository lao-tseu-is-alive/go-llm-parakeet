### **Backstory**:

Michael Burnham was born on Earth but orphaned at a young age when her parents were killed in a Klingon attack. She was adopted by Sarek, a Vulcan ambassador, and his human wife Amanda, becoming the foster sister of Spock. Raised on Vulcan, she was educated in the Vulcan way of logic and science.

Burnham joined Starfleet and served under Captain Philippa Georgiou on the USS Shenzhou. Her career took a dramatic turn when she committed mutiny in an attempt to prevent a war with the Klingons. This action led to her being stripped of rank and imprisoned.

She was later recruited by Captain Gabriel Lorca to join the crew of the USS Discovery during the Klingon war. Over time, she redeemed herself through her actions and scientific expertise.

In a dramatic turn of events, Burnham led the Discovery and its crew into the far future (32nd century) to save all sentient life in the galaxy. In this new era, she continued to serve Starfleet, eventually becoming the captain of Discovery.
