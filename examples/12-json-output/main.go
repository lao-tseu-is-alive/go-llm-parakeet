/*
This Go code snippet defines a main function that performs a chat completion using the Ollama and Parakeet libraries.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It sets the ollamaUrl variable to the URL of the Ollama server running on localhost.
2 .It sets the model variable to the name of the model to be used for the chat completion.
3. It defines the dataContent variable, which contains contextual information about a chicken.
4 .It defines the systemContent variable, which describes the role of the AI assistant and the expected inputs and outputs.
5 .It defines the userContent variable, which represents the user's input.
6. It creates an options variable with various settings for the chat completion, such as temperature, repeat penalties, and formatting options.
7. It creates a query variable, which contains the model name, the messages to be exchanged during the chat completion, and the options.
8. It calls the completion.Chat function with the Ollama URL and the query to perform the chat completion.
9. If the chat completion is successful, it prints the content of the last message received from the chat.
